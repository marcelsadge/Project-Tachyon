# MLB Swing Analyzer

MLB swing and pitch prediction built using Django. The only routes needed are below.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd baseball-app
python manage.py runserver
```

Example inputs are provided in players.xlsx.
pitch.ipynb contains raw dataset manipulation before it was wrapped by Django.

An example of a query below. Tyler Glasnow throws a lot of curveballs low and we
can find proof of that online. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkFh0HVk7j4&ab_channel=MadeTheCut
