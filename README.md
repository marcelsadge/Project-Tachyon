# Project-Tachyon

MLB swing and pitch prediction built using Django. The only routes needed are below.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd baseball-app
python manage.py runserver
```

Example inputs are provided in players.xlsx.
pitch.ipynb contains raw dataset manipulation before it was wrapped by Django.
